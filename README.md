# BDM-Project
This was completed as a university project for an information security course. Contributors include Jennifer, Kosta and Matthew.
Using Python's bottle framework, a website database was created that contains entries of births, deaths and marriages.
Security features include authentication and validation of input.

Requirements to run: Python 3 and the Bottle package
Usage: localhost:8080

Users can register accounts as a marriage officiator, funeral director, medical practitioner or staff.
They are then given authorized privileges to upload certificates onto the database or approve or reject certificates.
